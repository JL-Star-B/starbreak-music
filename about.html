			<img src="images/sona-icon.png" alt="Art of Starbreak's online persona" class="floatright">
			<p>
				Starbreak is a self-taught artist and electronic music composer born <br>
				on Long Island in 2001. uploading his first full song to Youtube in April of 2019, <br>
				he has continued to develop his style ever since, blending elements of Trance, <br>
				D&B, Future Bass, video game music and orchestral sounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starbreak believes that music is a very emotionally powerful art, and has the ability<br> 
				to soothe, empower and heal those that may need it. He aims to put as much of his own<br> 
				emotion into his songs as possible, and hopes to provide listeners with a short,<br> 
				yet meaningful escape into his music.
			</p>

			<h2 class="light">Background</h2>
			<p>
				Starbreak was homeschooled from a young age, growing up alongside his younger brother. They were best friends ever since their youth, and continue today to share their interests and creative works with each other. Starbreak has developed a stronger interest in music while still enjoying art, and his brother has gone on to focus and hone his art skills, while also developing his own musical abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				One Christmas while he was still young, Starbreak got his first video game console, a Nintendo DS Lite, along with several DS games, out of which one game particularly interested him. <br>
				That game was Kirby Superstar Ultra. After trying it out (and despite getting stuck multiple times on the first level), he fell immediately in love with it. <br>
				"It's funny to admit, but that day changed my life, and without that game I likely wouldn't have developed the interests I have now, music included." -Starbreak
			</p>
			<p>
				Him and his younger brother found their shared interest in art with the extra time spent at home, largely inspired by their newfound love of games. They'd fill sheets upon sheets of paper with small ameteur drawings in colored pencil. <br>
				"I'm grateful we were able to discover and foster our creative sides, and that we had each other. we were always talking about new ideas and getting involved with each other's creations all the way into our late teens." -Starbreak
			</p>
			<p>
				During his teens, Starbreak would try Geometry Dash for the first time while browsing mobile games, finally being fully exposed to electronic music. He quickly developed a love for various EDM genres that would carry through into his adult years, and would eventually begin exploring electronic music outside of Geometry Dash, following artists such as Tokyo Machine, Chime, Snail's House and others whose music presented the fun, energetic flavor he resonated with.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starbreak had also found a game during his teens called Rytmik Retrobits. Rytmik was a game that, at it's core, was just a simplified DAW application for the Nintendo DSI. Here is where he first dabbled in song composition, covering a multitude of songs from video game soundtracks for fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Near the end of his teen years, Starbreak had begun to consider making music as a hobby. He loved the idea of being able to create the music he loved, and since his favorite songs had done a lot for his state of mind through some emotionally difficult times, he liked the idea of others finding comfort in his work in the same way he had been comforted by his own inspirations.
			</p>
			<p>
				After some deliberation, he purchased an FL Studio license and began learning how to use the software, which he was able to do somewhat easier due to his prior experience with Rytmik. He spent several days straight developing a song through trial and error. <br>
				On April 5th of 2019, he uploaded his first official song, "Retro Metro", to his newly branded YouTube channel under the name "Starbreak", which he continues to use to this day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starbreak has gone on to hone his musical ability completely self-taught, using video tutorials and creative methods he's developed throughout his experience. He developed an interest in the PC game Friday Night Funkin' after the demo was released in 2020, and in 2021 he released Friday Night Funkin' Vs Void, his own mod for the game featuring his own music.
			</p>
			<p>
				The FNF mod allowed for Starbreak's songs to reach a larger audience, and ever since, the Starbreak community has been home to hundreds of fans of his music and characters, with the fanbase affectionately nicknamed "Stargazers." <br>
				Starbreak currently lives in Virginia with his family and two cats.
