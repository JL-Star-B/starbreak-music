					<p>
						A.C. Void is a sentient black hole in humanoid form, born from an anomaly of unknown origin out in deep space. He's the opponent of the Friday Night Funkin' mod of the same name, Vs. Void.
					</p>
					<p>
						Void is a pop star beloved across the galaxy, he has millions of fans and is extremely egotistical as a result. In FNF Vs. Void, he hears of the Boyfriend's easy victory against Daddy Dearest, and invites Bf to sing with him at his next concert out in deep space. Saying that Void was being overconfident would be an understatement, and things will soon take a dangerous turn once he starts realizing this...
					</p>
					<p>
						Void spends most of his time performing concerts across the galaxy and residing in his various space estates. He lives with his two assistants (the Accretions), and his space cat, Jet. The four were all born from the same event, a deep space anomaly which hyper-compressed a black hole into physical forms with living souls, but the details beyond that are unknown.
					</p>

					<h3>Abilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Levitation</i></b> - Void can manipulate gravity in a small area around him or other objects, allowing him to float as well as levitate objects. He will often switch between standing on the ground and floating as he pleases, and can levitate items around him, such as his microphone for example.</li>
						<li><b><i>Photokinesis</i></b> - Void ambiently absorbs light from around him at all times, which he can then re-organize and emit from his body or accoutrements. This is how he displays his face and makes parts of his coat, pants and tie light up on command.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Trivia</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Void's true age is unknown. He is mentally in his mid-twenties, but various accounts reveal that he might be several hundred years old, at the very least.</li>
						<li>Void's whole body is composed of various particles and space gasses, infinitely compressed so that they actually form a solid substance. To the touch, it somehow feels like a cross between skin and felt. The spikes on his head are slightly less compressed, giving them a hair-like softness.</li>
						<li>Since Void's face is formed of super-condensed light particles, it's completely intangible and has no physical features. Because of this, his face is entirely malleable, and along with simply morphing to show normal expressions, it could technically take any shape he chooses.</li>
						<li>Similarly to how Void's face is redistributed light, his voice is formed of redistributed sound. Any ambient sound gets absorbed by his body, which he then can organize and re-emit as a voice. This is also what gives his voice it's electronic, naturally autotuned sound.</li>
