			<h2 class="light">The Artist</h2>
			
			<p>
				Starbreak is a self-taught artist and electronic music composer born <br>
				on Long Island in 2001. uploading his first full song to Youtube in April of 2019, <br>
				he has continued to develop his style ever since, blending elements of Trance, <br>
				D&B, Future Bass, video game music and orchestral sounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starbreak believes that music is a very emotionally powerful art, and has the ability<br> 
				to soothe, empower and heal those that may need it. He aims to put as much of his own<br> 
				emotion into his songs as possible, and hopes to provide listeners with a short,<br> 
				yet meaningful escape into his music.
			</p>

			<h2 class="light">Background</h2>
			<p>
				Starbreak was homeschooled from a young age, growing up alongside his younger brother. They were best friends ever since their youth, and continue today to share their interests and creative works with each other. <br>
				One Christmas while he was still young, Starbreak got his first video game console, a Nintendo DS Lite, along with several DS games. One of these games would particularly interest him. <br>
				That game was Kirby Superstar Ultra. After exploring the game (and despite getting stuck multiple times on the first level), he fell immediately in love with it. This would effectively shape his interests for years to come, and eventually inspire his musical personality. <br>
				He and his younger brother found their shared interest in art with the extra time spent at home, largely inspired by their now-shared love of video games. They began to discover and foster their creative voices in each other's company, constantly dreaming up new ideas and getting involved in each other's creations well into their late teens.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this time, Starbreak would discover the mobile game Geometry Dash, and finally see his first exposure to electronic music. He quickly developed a great love for various EDM genres that would carry through into his adult years, eventually exploring electronic artists outside of Geometry Dash. These artists included Tokyo Machine, Chime, Snail's House and others whose music presented the bright, energetic flavor he had grown to love. <br>
				Starbreak had also found a game during his teens called Rytmik Retrobits. Rytmik was a game that, at it's core, was simply a stripped-down DAW application for the Nintendo DSI. Here is where he would first dabble in song composition, covering a multitude of songs from his favorite video game soundtracks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Near the end of his teen years, Starbreak had begun to consider making music as a hobby, blending his love of character design with original songs. He loved the idea of being able to create the music he adored, and after his favorite songs had helped him through some emotionally difficult times, he liked the idea of others finding comfort in his work in the same way he had been comforted by his own inspirations. <br>
				He would eventually purchase an FL Studio license and begin familiarizing himself with the software, made easier after his time spent with Rytmik. It was also at this time that he decided on the name "Starbreak" for his online presence, chosen simply due to his love of space, as well as his desire to incorporate the aesthetic into his music. <br>
				After experimentation and much trial and error, he uploaded his first official song, "Retro Metro", to his newly branded YouTube channel on April 5th of 2019. Starbreak has gone on to hone his musical ability completely self-taught, learning through video tutorials early on and developing his own creative methods throughout his experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				He found an interest in the PC game Friday Night Funkin' after the demo's release in 2020, and in 2021 he released Friday Night Funkin' Vs Void, his own mod for the game featuring his own music. The mod's success brought Starbreak's music to a larger audience and marked the beginning of a true community. <br>
				Since then, the Starbreak community has been home to hundreds of fans of his work, with the members of his fanbase affectionately nicknamed "Stargazers". Starbreak continues today to create feel-good electronic music inspired by the beloved games of his youth and his love of space, as well as numerous other concepts and aesthetics. <br>
				He currently lives in Virginia with his family and two cats.
