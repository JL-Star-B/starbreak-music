    <p>This text is a placeholder; I thought it would be fun to hide some files or art via tiny links throughout the different pages of the site.<br>
    I thought hiding links to simple pages containing art from my channel or small music downloads would be a neat little inclusion and<br>
    give the site a bit more intrigue for visitors who come accross them.</p>
    <p>I was honestly just having fun and thought it'd be a cool idea to implement. ^-^</p>
