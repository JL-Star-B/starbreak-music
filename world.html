						<p>
							A.C. Void is a sentient black hole in humanoid form, born from an anomaly of unknown origin out in deep space. He's the opponent of the Friday Night Funkin' mod of the same name, Vs. Void.
						</p>
						<p>
							Void is a pop star beloved across the galaxy, he has millions of fans and is extremely egotistical as a result. In FNF Vs. Void, he hears of the Boyfriend's easy victory against Daddy Dearest, and invites Bf to sing with him at his next concert out in deep space. Saying that Void was being overconfident would be an understatement, and things will soon take a dangerous turn once he starts realizing this...
						</p>
						<p>
							Void spends most of his time performing concerts across the galaxy and residing in his various space estates. He lives with his two assistants (the Accretions), and his space cat, Jet. The four were all born from the same event, a deep space anomaly which hyper-compressed a black hole into physical forms with living souls, but the details beyond that are unknown.
						</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Abilities</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b><i>Levitation</i></b> - Void can manipulate gravity in a small area around him or other objects, allowing him to float as well as levitate objects. He will often switch between standing on the ground and floating as he pleases, and can levitate items around him, such as his microphone for example.</li>
							<li><b><i>Photokinesis</i></b> - Void ambiently absorbs light from around him at all times, which he can then re-organize and emit from his body or accoutrements. This is how he displays his face and makes parts of his coat, pants and tie light up on command.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>

						<h3>Trivia</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Void's true age is unknown. He is mentally in his mid-twenties, but various accounts reveal that he might be several hundred years old, at the very least.</li>
							<li>Void's weight is actually surprisingly modest for a humanoid black hole, despite seeming astronomically disproportionate to his size. Unfathomable amounts of mass have been compressed into his body, seeing as most black holes can weigh as much as millions of our suns combined. His weight never poses a challenge to him as he simply manipulates the space around him to be in near zero-gravity at all times.</li>
							<li>Void's whole body is composed of various particles and space gasses, infinitely compressed so that they actually form a solid substance. To the touch, his skin has been said to feel like an odd cross between flesh and felt. The spikes on his head are slightly less compressed, giving them a hair-like softness.</li>
							<li>Since Void's face is formed of super-condensed light particles, it's completely intangible and has no physical features. Because of this, his face is entirely malleable, and along with simply morphing to show normal expressions, it could technically take any shape he chooses.</li>
							<li>Similarly to how Void's face is redistributed light, his voice is formed of redistributed sound. Any ambient sound gets absorbed by his body, which he then can organize and re-emit as a voice. This is also what gives his voice it's electronic, naturally autotuned sound.</li>
							<li>Void has no physical organs (or physical mouth, for that matter) and can't eat food, nor does he need to. However, by absorbing matter into his face he can "eat" practically anything, edible or not. He'll often "eat" when meeting with others or just for his own amusement, but it's completely unnecessary.</li>

						<p>
							All Consuming Void is the title given to Void at his strongest state. The black hole's true fury reveals itself and poses a threat to any who challenge it.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this form, Void's usual smug persona is no longer a concern of his, and he instead becomes a cold, nihilistic entity that will snap into a destructive rage at a moment's notice. Void has only entered this state a mere few of times, and it's only triggered when he's pushed to his limit and put under immense stress for an extended period of time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Void is aware of his stronger form's destructive and uncontrollable disposition, and due to high risk of hurting his image (as well as risk to his fans' safety) he fearfully avoids any situations that may push him to give into his anger and lose control.
						</p>
						<p>
							At least he <i>usually</i> avoids these situations.

						<h3>Trivia</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>All Consuming Void is NOT necessarily a separate being to Void, he's moreso just a stronger state he enters that drastically changes his personality. Still, both forms operate and think vastly different from one another, and Void usually disapproves of his other form's behavior.</li>

							The Accretions are Void's two security gaurds/personal assistants. They are most often see following Void around his various public excursions, running errands for him, or simply standing behind him for supposed intimidation.
						</p>
						<p>
							They don't seem to go by any names, strangely enough, and their demeanors seem near identical at face value, much like their identical appearances. However it has been observed that "Accretion 1" is more talkitive and inquisitive to some degree, while "Accretion 2" rarely speaks and appears to prefer keeping to himself, though in moments he'll be more up-front or aggresive than his bodyguard partner.

						<p>
							Gemm is a spry, heroic android built by the villainous Drill Corp as the prototype of a superweapon soldier for their mechanical conquest. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The Drill Corp harvest potent Electite crystals to fuel their strongest machines, so when they came across a near-perfect Electite gem, they saw it as the ideal power source for their new superweapon, and used it to bring Gemm to life. The gem's power was so concentrated that, combined with the complexity of the A.I. developed for Gemm's body, he became fully sentient and rebelled against his creators in the name of justice.
						</p>
						<p>
							Carrying the potent crystal as his heart, Gemm now lives on the run from the Drill Corp. The Corp is far from achieving full rule of the galaxy's electricity supply, but if Gemm is captured, he will be disassembled, and his gem repurposed to power some new lifeless superweapon to aid in their domination.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gemm is bombastic and agile in combat, designed to be a near-unstoppable force, but when not battling his creators, he is a rather peaceful and thoughtful soul. He often contemplates his own life, simply appreciating that he was miraculously given the means to experience it in the first place. He's not easily bothered by much as he is well aware of the power he possesses, but he hates any form of cruelty or injustice, and overreacting to this without caution can sometimes be problematic for Gemm or those around him. He can easily be as thoughful as a philosopher one moment, and niave as a child the next.
						</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Abilities</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b><i>Swordfighting</i></b> - Gemm can unsheath a reinforced Electite sword from a compartment on his back, and is preprogrammed with a lethal ability to use it. Being built from Electite, the sword is also extremely receptive to electric discharge from Gemm's heart, enhancing its power and utility.</li>
							<li><b><i>Electricity Generation</i></b> - Gemm's crystal heart generates electricity endlessly, and Gemm not only feeds on this constant charge to remain operational, but can also freely utilize said electricity for combat by supercharging his body and sword, or unleashing electric bursts as a ranged attack.</li>
							<li><b><i>Super Speed and Agility</i></b> - Due to his slim design and boundless energy, Gemm can run at breakneck speeds without much need to rest, as well as jump and dash to great heights with his foot-mounted discharge boosters. These skills, coupled with his combat prowess and electric attacks, leave Gemm a force to be reckoned with.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>

						<h3>Trivia</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Gemm stands for "Geologically Enhanced Mechanical Mercenary", which was originally the project name originally given to him by his less-than-kind-intentioned creators.</li>
							<li>The bronze-colored parts of Gemm's body are actually components made from a copper/titanium alloy designed to increase the mobility of Gemm's electricity, as copper is highly conductive.</li>
							<li>Gemm highly values his sentience and acknowledges how precious life is. As such, he is VERY opposed to combat with organic life, mainly using his strength to fend off the Drill Corp's robots whenever they pose a threat to his freedom. Gemm <i>will</i> still accept a no-holds-barred fight against an organic being, but only if ablsolutely necessary, highly preferring to keep to a spar if pitted against organic life.</li>

He can cause a sleeping individual to dream, alter their dreams and ward off nightmares, and he seems to derive great satisfaction in doing so, as if he's simply happy to help.</li>
							<li><b><i>Sedation</i></b> - Dream spirits are capable of pulling a waking mind into the Dreamworld, effectively putting one into a deep sleep. Nap <i>does</i> possess this ability, but it's not yet something he can do easily or reliably.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>

						<h3>Trivia</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Nap can speak, but rarely does so. He usually prefers to quietly interact with the world and people around him, though he <i>will</i> utter the occasional word when inclined to do so.</li>
							<li>200 years old is actually quite young for a Dream Spirit; Nap is only a toddler! In their youth, Dream Spirits are naturally inclined to explore thier realm of the Dreamworld and watch over the land while they grow familiar with it. Once finally mature, they will have the wisdom and strength to rule and defend their home from nightmares. That said, few have ever seen the majesty of an adult Dream Spirit themselves.</li>
